# ApsCalc
From the Depths APS Shell calculator.  WORK IN PROGRESS

Limitations:
  - Does not calculate HE, frag, FlaK, or EMP damage directly; uses the multipier instead, because all those warheads scale the same way, so the most efficient HE configuration is also the most efficient configuration for FlaK, frag, and EMP
  - Does not calculate accuracy

Planned Features:
  - Integration with my armor layout pierce calculator, for testing pendepth shells against a given armor configuration and only saving shells which pen
  - Multithreading to speed up shell calculations, especially shells using rail draw


Massive thanks to HerpeDerpeDerpe and MrNukealizer, without whom this project would not have been possible.
